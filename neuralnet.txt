Neural Net activity

1. Start with the initial setup.  Push Play.  After 50 epochs, what is your test loss and training loss? 


2. Run it until about 250 epochs.  What is your test loss and training loss?


3.  Hypothesize what would happen if you decrease the ratio of training to test data to 20%.  Specifically, state what you think will happen to the test loss and training loss and why.  

4. What actually happens?  


5.  Reset it to 50%.  Reduce the number of hidden layers to 0 and run it until it converges.  What is the training/testing loss?  Why?

6.  Switch the data set to the second one (it has blue in the upper right and lower left corners).  Run it until it converges.  What is the training/testing loss? 

7. Increase the hidden layers to 8 neurons each and run it until it converges.  What is the training/testing loss?  Explain why the increase in neurons had this effect.  

8.  Change the data to the spiral set and reset the hidden layers to 4 and 2.  Run it for about 1000 epochs.  Give the training/testing loss, and describe the situation.  

9.  Increase the hidden layers to 8 neurons each and run it for about 1000 epochs.  Give the training/testing loss, and describe the situation in comparison to question 8.  

10.  Add the sin(x1) and sin(x2) inputs and run it for 1000 epochs.  Describe the results.

11.  Change the data set back to the initial one and the layers back to 4 and 2, with the sin inputs still added.  Reduce the training to test to 10%.  Run it until it converges.  What are the training/test losses?

12.  Remove the sin inputs and run it again.  How does it change the training/test losses?  Why?  

13.  Devise your own experiment to demonstrate an AI concept.  Make sure to name the concept and carefully describe the experiment and the result.
